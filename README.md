# Graph Thinness using SageMath

Calculate the thinness and proper thinness of graphs with `n` vertices using SageMath and the Z3 SMT solver.

## Running locally
- Install SageMath
- Install pipenv
- Run `pipenv --site-packages install`
- Run `pipenv run main` for an example run

## Classification of small graphs
The minimal graphs for each thinness and proper thinness value for graphs with up to 10 vertices can be found in the CSV files in [data/](data/).
